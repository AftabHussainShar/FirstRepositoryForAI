AI Readme
This repository contains examples of artificial intelligence (AI) models and algorithms implemented using Python. The models include neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines, among others.

Installation
To use the models in this repository, you will need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed, as well as the following Python packages:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow
To install these packages, you can use the following command:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
Usage
Each of the models in this repository is implemented as a Python class. To use a model, simply create an instance of the class and call the appropriate methods. For example, to train a neural network model on a dataset, you can do the following:

python
Copy code
from neural_network import NeuralNetwork

# Load data
X, y = load_data()

# Create model
model = NeuralNetwork(hidden_layers=[64, 32], num_classes=10)

# Train model
model.fit(X, y)
